\begin{abstract}

Project And Problem overview (abstract) What are you planning to do?  What is the task? Classification? Regression? \\ \\ We aim to train a classifier to predict a song's genre based on its lyrics. The model will be trained and evaluated on a dataset of 380,000 song lyrics from Kaggle. However, we will extrapolate features from the lyrics with the support of Natural Language Processing techniques. For example, we will evaluate: line count, syllable count, rhyme frequency, amount of variation in rhyme scheme.

\section{Data Description and Source}

\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} is very important! If you are not working with a pre-existing dataset, you must convince me that the data for your project exists and is easily accessible (e.g. can easily be scraped from a public website) Tell me what your features (attributes, columns of your data matrix X) will be.
