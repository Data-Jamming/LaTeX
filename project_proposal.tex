\begin{abstract}

We aim to explore the relationships between lyrical content and different music genres by constructing multiple classifiers to predict a song's genre based solely on its lyrics. In this domain, we will test our intuition about each genre's distinctive attributes and investigate more opaque and subtle patterns. We intend to implement a traditional classifier trained on a set of NLP features derived from the lyrics as well as a deep learning model; we will then compare and contrast their respective accuracies and areas of error.\par

\section{Introduction}

    \IEEEPARstart{O}{ur} models will be trained and tested on a dataset that contains 380,000 song lyrics and their corresponding genres, available on Kaggle.com and originally scraped from metrolyrics.com \cite{KaggleDataset}; the dataset spans 10 genres: country, electronic, folk, hip-hop, indie, jazz, metal, pop, R\&B, and rock. Before training, we will preprocess the data by cleaning it (e.g. removing the relatively few songs without given genres) and generating NLP features to describe the data; features such as part-of-speech (POS) frequency, line/word/syllable count, and rhyme scheme will be evaluated using NLP techniques and tools such as Python NLTK \cite{NLTK}.\par

\section{Related Work}

\IEEEPARstart{T}{here} exist numerous attempts at classifying songs into genres solely by their lyrical content using neural networks and more traditional models such as SVM, k- nearest neighbor, etc.
Tsaptsinos \cite{tsaptsinos} extended the use of hierarchical attention networks (HAN) -- a type of recurrent neural network previously proposed and employed by Yang et al. \cite{Yang} for document classification -- to the lyrics-based music genre classification problem, demonstrating the model's ability to outperform the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model when classifying across 117 genres. The HAN model performed particularly well when attention was placed at the line-level, as opposed to the segment level; that is, the model's accuracy benefited from considering lines individually instead of a block of lines (e.g. a refrain) as a whole unit. \par

\section{Data Description and Source}

\emph{This is very important! If you are not working with a pre-existing dataset, you must convince me that the data for your project exists and is easily accessible (e.g. can easily be scraped from a public website) Tell me what your features (attributes, columns of your data matrix X) will be.}

\section{Distribution of Tasks Among Team Members}

Each team member is a lead in a specific area and is required to delegate tasks in their area accordingly. This will aide in equally distributing the workload and involving team members to contribute in every aspect.\\ 

The team leaders are as follows:
