\begin{abstract}

We aim to explore the relationships between lyrical content and different music genres by constructing multiple classifiers to predict a song's genre based solely on its lyrics. In this domain, we will test our intuition about each genre's distinctive attributes and investigate more opaque and subtle patterns. We intend to implement a traditional classifier trained on a set of NLP features derived from the lyrics as well as a deep learning model; we will then compare and contrast their respective accuracies and areas of error.\par

\section{Introduction}

    \IEEEPARstart{O}{ur} models will be trained and tested on a dataset that contains 380,000 song lyrics and their corresponding genres, available on Kaggle.com and originally scraped from metrolyrics.com \cite{KaggleDataset}; the dataset spans 10 genres: country, electronic, folk, hip-hop, indie, jazz, metal, pop, R\&B, and rock. Before training, we will preprocess the data by cleaning it (e.g. removing the relatively few songs without given genres) and generating NLP features to describe the data; features such as part-of-speech (POS) frequency, line/word/syllable count, and rhyme scheme will be evaluated using NLP techniques and tools such as Python NLTK \cite{NLTK}.\par

\section{Related Work}

\IEEEPARstart{T}{here} exists numerous attempts at classifying songs into genres solely by their lyrical content by classification methods including neural networks and commonly used classification models such as SVM, k- nearest neighbor, etc. \\ \\One article used both recurrent neural network models and simple classifier methods to reclassify a dataset of around 500,000 song lyrics and 20 genres, similar to the dataset to be used in this study of 380,000 song lyrics and 10 genres. However, instead of just using a feature set containing syllable count, line count, word count, rhyme frequency, and rhyme scheme they also decided to use a hierarchical attention network. This relies on the model learning and using the word embedding?s, hierarchical attention, and gated recurrent units rather than hand selected features. This study resulted in a trend between the model complexity and classification accuracy, showing that as complexity increases so does the accuracy. Thus, the neural net performed much more accurately throughout their study \cite{tsaptsinos}.

\section{Data Description and Source}

\emph{This is very important! If you are not working with a pre-existing dataset, you must convince me that the data for your project exists and is easily accessible (e.g. can easily be scraped from a public website) Tell me what your features (attributes, columns of your data matrix X) will be.}

\section{Distribution of Tasks Among Team Members}

Each team member is a lead in a specific area and is required to delegate tasks in their area accordingly. This will aide in equally distributing the workload and involving team members to contribute in every aspect.\\ 

The team leaders are as follows:
